## Part 1 - Implement Fast Poisson Disk Sampling
- Accomplished in this part: I am using the Bridson's paper on [Poisson Disk Sampling Method for Arbitrary Dimensions](./Part1Info/PoissonDiskPaper.pdf) to make a point cloud representation of a given mesh in both two and three dimensions. Previous sampling techniques include Cook's 1986 paper that discusses Stochastic Sampling [a Monte Carlo technique]. This technique improved the issues of aliasing by allowing for noise instead by aiming to implement Poisson disk sampling; however, the paper focused on using the jitter of a regular grid as a way to implement the sampling due memory costs of the randomness of a look-up table for Poisson disk sampling. Like actual Poisson disk sampling, jittering also is well suited for image-rendering algorithms and removes some aliasing; however the results are not quite as good as those actually obtained with the original sampling technique; additionally, the images still maintain a bit of aliasing and noise due to only a reduction but not complete elimination of sample clustering. Dunbar and Humphrey's papers in 2006 describe an improved on the implementation of Poisson sampling; by using an efficient data structure they are able to perform uniform sampling within the r and 2r radii around each sampled location, and by maintaining that each valid sample must contain at least one other sample within the range of those two radii, their algorithm works as intended. However, this technique did not easily generalize for uses in rendering with additional effects such as motion blur and depth of field in higher dimensions [mainly 3D for rendering], therefore, Bridson's algorithm is the preferred implementation for this project. As Bridson's previously linked paper delineates, his algorithm easily extends to n-dimensions while still running in O(N) time to generate the requested N poisson disk samples [aka running proportional to the number of requested samples]. Additionally, in contrast with Dunbar and Humphrey's approach, once the samples are picked from the appropriate region, Bridson's algorithm uses rejection sampling [when an existing sample no longer has any new/valid samples within its valid sample range it is rejected] instead of using the clear cut restrictions to compute the allowed sampling region. This is beneficial as it allows the sampling to develop more organically thus reducing the chaoticness of the random selection, speeding up the process as a whole, making Bridson's algorithm efficient for two-dimensional and n-dimensional space.
