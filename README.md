# CIS700FANFU-Simulation

## Part 1 - Implement Fast Poisson Disk Sampling
- Accomplished in this part: I am using the [Poisson Disk Sampling Method for Arbitrary Dimensions](CIS700Fanfu-PhysicsBasedMaterialSimulation/Part1Info/PoissonDiskPaper.pdf) to make a point cloud representation of a given mesh in both two and three dimensions.
